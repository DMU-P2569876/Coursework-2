    <p> Videography may be my all time favourite form of media. Having complete creative freedom and
      forming stories out of clips of film is so fascinating to me. I love how someone can become encaptured
      in your work.</p>

<!-- NOTE: I had to use an unrelated, replacement video as the actual one I intended on using was too large of a file to upload to Github. The other video was also too
large to convert online so my only option was to use a replacement just to prove I could actually code the video correctly. -->

<!-- NOTE: The control attribute supplies the video with a play and pause button when the page is loaded in a browser -->
<!-- NOTE: The width attribute scales the video the fit the page appropriately. If this isn't done then it won't all fit in one frame. -->
<p>This was an assignment set for my moving image module at University. We had the choice of either creating
a public informational film or a short news package. I decided to create an informational film based on road safety - specifically at night.
This was a super fun piece as I could be as creative as I'd like and had little restriction on the end product - as long as it related to
the set task.</p>
