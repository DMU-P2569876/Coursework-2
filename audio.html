  <p> Audio production and editing isn't something I had tried until I joined University. I have always
  been intrigued by and since having a go, I have really enjoyed it. </p>

  <h2>Live Presentation - Coursework - May 2021 </h2>
<!-- NOTE: h2 attribute supplies a smaller sub heading -->

  <p>This was the second piece of coursework I completed for my Audio module at University.
  This includes a scripted element, voxpops and an interview. I loved combining all the audio elements
and putting together a final piece. The subject is based on Covid-19s effect on Pet Sales & rehoming. </p>

<p>Sorry, your browser does not support the audio element.</p>

<!-- NOTE: The original audio file I intended on using was too large for github so I've had to use a replacement which will most probably doc me of marks but i had no choice. -->
<!-- NOTE: By providing different formats of audio, the audio piece should be supported by most browsers.
If the browser doesn't support any of those formats, a message will pop up apologising. -->

<p> Creating audio has been super interesting - especially learning all about the editing of volumes and how to properly
record e.g. correct microphones, settings, sound booths... </p>
