<p> Photography was the first form of Media Production I properly experimented with at the age of 15.
  When learning and developing you can really decipher what style you aim for and what you're comfortable with.
  Below I have included some photography projects from different periods to show how my style has changed.</p>


<h2> Aylsetone Park, Leicester, Leicestershire - January 2021 </h2>
  <img src="images/shoot1a.jpg" alt="Bridge over floods" style="max-width: 50%"/>
  <img src="images/shoot1b.jpg" alt="Bridge over pond" style="max-width: 50%"/>
  <img src="images/shoot1c.jpg" alt="Woodlands" style="max-width: 50%"/>
<p> These images were taken for a piece of university coursework. The main focus is supposed to be that the images all
run centre frame and are nicely balanced with the exterior features.
These were also taken whilst I was teaching myself about apeture and even though most turned out awful, towards the end I
grasped the idea and produced these shots.</p>

<h2> Woodchester Lakes, Stroud, Gloucestershire - April 2021 </h2>
<img src="images/shoot2a.jpg" alt="Joe 1" style="max-width: 50%">
<img src="images/shoot2b.jpg" alt="Joe 2" style="max-width: 50%">
<img src="images/shoot2c.jpg" alt="Joe 3" style="max-width: 50%">
<p> This was the turning point for when I started to discover my favourite form of photography.
In April I played around with silhouette photography and also increasing the black point in post editing
and really loved the results. I had my partner go and skim some rocks down by the lake and captured his silhouette
contrasting against the colourful woodlands and water.</p>

<h2>Leicester City, Leicestershire - May 2021</h2>
<img src="images/shoot3a.jpg" alt="The Summit" style="max-width: 50%">
<img src="images/shoot3b.jpg" alt="Upperton Road" style="max-width: 50%">
<img src="images/shoot3c.jpg" alt="Wilberforce Road"style="max-width: 50%">

<p> Building on my love for silhouette photography, I thought I'd try it on man made landscapes. The first was taken in the
evening so the sunset held strong/bold colours. This made the contrast nice and strong, resulting in a great photo.
The last two were taken in the early hours of the morning around 5am. The sky is more of a pure blue and a lot more mellow
compared to the evening shot. These are nice because the black areas help exaggerate the clear skies. </p>
